# Dynamical-Systems
This repository is a collection of scripts relating to the paper "An Exploration of Dynamical Systems in Physics and Mathematics" written for Dr. Marcin Abram's PHYS 304 at the University of Southern California by Sameer Bijwadia. 

Run all programs in MATLAB
MandelbrotSet.m --> Run for a production of the Mandelbrot set
JuliaSets.m --> Choose a parameter c, then run. The Julia set for Q_c(x) will be generated
QuadraticMapBifurcation.m --> Choose resolution and boundaries for parameter c, and the bifurcation diagram for Q_c(x) will be generated
LogisticMap.m --> Choose resolution and boundaries for parameter r, and the bifurcation diagram for the logistic map will be generated
